-- Specification for a mean reversion algorithm --

Idea:
1) Read in asset price on most granular resolution - fill an array
2) Calculate past x days rolling average
3) Buy first time it goes more than say 5% below that
4) Sell first time it goes say 5% above that

Functions:

double* readPrices(std::istream input);
// Produces an array that has the data on our granular resolution

void calcPriceLevels(double& buyPrice, double& sellPrice);
// Calculates past x days rolling average and returns say 5% below as buy and 5% above as buy. Can adjust percentages

void executeTrade(int t);
// Checks whether the buyPrice or sellPrice is surpassed and trades based on that, in units of choosable size

So classes:

Asset
